      <p>
        Below is a collection of some of the projects I have been quite happy with. These are a collection of works that I have
        done both at university and outside of university. 
        <br />
        Each project will have a link to the source code on Github as well as 
        a description of what the application was, how it was built and some of the key learnings from it.
